# Backend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/FightCore/Backend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/FightCore/Backend)

The backend project for the FightCore application.
This contains both the API and the Identity Server for simplicity reasons.

## Tech used

The FightCore API runs as a dotnet core 2.2 API using the Identity Server 4 as
a way of authenticating users.
OAuth 2 should be properly implemented to allow the users of the API to execute
any action that is also possible on the website and more.

This is also the design ideology behind FightCore and as well its API.
It's meant to be as open as possible and allow changes from the smash developing community.
